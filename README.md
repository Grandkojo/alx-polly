This document provides a comprehensive overview of the security vulnerabilities that were identified in the ALX Polly application and the remediation measures implemented to address them.

### üö® Critical Vulnerabilities Identified & Fixed

#### 1. **Authorization Bypass in Poll Deletion** - CRITICAL ‚úÖ FIXED

**Vulnerability Description:**
- **Location**: `app/lib/actions/poll-actions.ts:99-105`
- **Issue**: The `deletePoll` function lacked proper authorization checks
- **Impact**: Any authenticated user could delete ANY poll in the system, regardless of ownership

**Before (Vulnerable Code):**
```typescript
export async function deletePoll(id: string) {
  const supabase = await createClient();
  const { error } = await supabase.from("polls").delete().eq("id", id);
  // ‚ùå NO USER AUTHENTICATION CHECK
  // ‚ùå NO OWNERSHIP VERIFICATION
}
```

**After (Secure Implementation):**
```typescript
export async function deletePoll(id: string) {
  const supabase = await createClient();
  
  // Get user from session
  const { data: { user }, error: userError } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
  
  if (!user) {
    return { error: "You must be logged in to delete a poll." };
  }

  // Only allow deleting polls owned by the user
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from("polls")
    .delete()
    .eq("id", id)
    .eq("user_id", user.id);
}
```

**Remediation Steps:**
1. Added user authentication verification
2. Implemented ownership-based authorization
3. Added proper error handling for unauthorized access

**Before (Vulnerable Code):**
```typescript
// Client-side data fetching without authorization
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("polls")
  .select("*")  // ‚ùå Fetches ALL polls without server-side authorization
  .order("created_at", { ascending: false });
```

**After (Secure Implementation):**
- Created `app/lib/actions/admin-actions.ts` with server-side authorization
- Implemented email-based admin verification
- Converted admin page to server-side rendering with proper access control

**Remediation Steps:**
1. Created dedicated admin actions with authorization checks
2. Implemented server-side admin verification

#### 3. **Vote Manipulation Vulnerability** - HIGH ‚úÖ FIXED

**Vulnerability Description:**
- **Location**: `app/lib/actions/poll-actions.ts:77-96`
- **Issue**: No duplicate vote prevention, no input validation, no rate limiting
- **Impact**: Users could vote multiple times, vote for non-existent options, or perform vote flooding

**Before (Vulnerable Code):**
```typescript
export async function submitVote(pollId: string, optionIndex: number) {
  const supabase = await createClient();
  // ‚ùå No duplicate vote prevention
  // ‚ùå No rate limiting
  // ‚ùå Option index not validated against poll options
}
```

**After (Secure Implementation):**
```typescript
export async function submitVote(pollId: string, optionIndex: number) {
  // Validate poll ID and option index
  const pollIdValidation = validatePollId(pollId);
  if (!pollIdValidation.isValid) {
    return { error: pollIdValidation.error };
  }

  // Get the poll to validate option index
  const { data: poll, error: pollError } = await supabase
    .from("polls")
    .select("options")
    .eq("id", pollId)
    .single();

  // Validate option index is within bounds
  const optionIndexValidation = validateOptionIndex(optionIndex, poll.options.length);
  
  // Check for existing vote if user is logged in
  if (user) {
    const { data: existingVote } = await supabase
      .from("votes")
      .select("id")
      .eq("poll_id", pollId)
      .eq("user_id", user.id)
      .single();

    if (existingVote) {
      return { error: "You have already voted on this poll." };
    }
  }
}
```

**Remediation Steps:**
1. Added comprehensive input validation
2. Implemented duplicate vote prevention for authenticated users
3. Added poll existence verification
4. Implemented option index validation against poll options

const options = formData.getAll("options").filter(Boolean) as string[];
```

**After (Secure Implementation):**
- Created comprehensive validation system (`lib/validation.ts`)
- Implemented XSS protection with input sanitization
- Added length limits and content validation

**New Validation System:**
```typescript
// lib/validation.ts
export function sanitizeString(input: string): string {
  return input
    .replace(/[<>]/g, '') // Remove < and > to prevent XSS
    .replace(/javascript:/gi, '') // Remove javascript: protocol
    .replace(/on\w+=/gi, '') // Remove event handlers
    .trim();
}

export function validatePollQuestion(question: string): { isValid: boolean; error?: string } {
  if (!question || typeof question !== 'string') {
    return { isValid: false, error: 'Question is required.' };
  }
  
  const sanitized = sanitizeString(question);
  
  if (sanitized.length < 3) {
    return { isValid: false, error: 'Question must be at least 3 characters long.' };
  }
  
  if (sanitized.length > 500) {
    return { isValid: false, error: 'Question must be less than 500 characters.' };
  }
  
  return { isValid: true };
}
```

**Remediation Steps:**
1. Created comprehensive input validation utilities
2. Implemented XSS protection with input sanitization
